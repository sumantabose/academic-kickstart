# Biography

I am a Senior Research Engineer in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx) at [Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx). I work on full-stack [distributed ledger technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) system research, with specialization in [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). Currently, I'm developing our group's in-house application agnostic blockchain platform. My job also involves working with different blockchain implementations such as [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum), [Corda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R3_(company)#Corda) and [Hyperledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperledger). Our group is led by [Prof. Kwok-Yan Lam](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=KWOKYAN.LAM) and [Asst. Prof. Anupam Chattopadhyay](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ANUPAM).
